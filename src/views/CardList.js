// THIS IS THE PAGE FEATURING HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTIONS OF ORDERS USING "CARDS"
// It is basically one div that will contain many cards (from Card.js)

// THE PRESENTER WILL GIVE THIS COMPONENT THE FORMATTED "CardData"
// (Remember -> CardData will build the JSON format for information shown on all cards)
