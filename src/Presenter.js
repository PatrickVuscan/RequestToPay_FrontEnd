// This will replace Control.js

// We only have 1 presenter

// -------------------

// It's responsibilities are:
// - handle events due to user input, talk to model layer, then get updates in view again
// - when handling events, it will speak to model layer (models/index.js):
//     - tell view to show it is waiting for a response (if it chooses to represent this)
//     - make use of a model layer
// - when receiving info from model layer, it will:
//     - update view data (to package up the information for the view)
//     - then send the view data back to the view
